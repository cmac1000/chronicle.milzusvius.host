Having fought off the undead attack, the party disables the remaining traps planted by [Sunega](/characters/sunega/) and investigates the box. [Zirfiel](/characters/zirfiel/) discovers that the box is a phylactery covered in infernal script, warning against opening. Having successfully suggested to Sunega that the box belongs in a museum, the party heads towards Waterdeep.

Zirfiel and [Ev](/characters/ev/) decide to, and then decide not to, murder Sunega.

The party, along with Sunega and her thugs, enter Waterdeep and head into the northern neighborhoods, ending up at the building where Ev arranged to drop the package to [Barclay](/characters/barclay/). Upon inspection, they discover that Barclay is dead, having seemingly exploded. Investigation reveals the following:

* a sense of infernal presence
* in a secret compartment in Barclay's office desk, books of speculation on links between Waterdeep houses and the internal hierarchy
* correspondence between Barclay and his sister with envelopes addressed "SC"

Zirfiel writes Sunega a receipt from the "Barclay Museum" acknowledging delivery of the box. Sunega exits.

The party discusses what to do next. Zirfiel reveals the sinister nature of the box, and recommends delivery to his temple, which specializes in handling dangerous artifacts. He tells [Dima](/characters/dima/) and [Portia](/characters/portia/) that they will likely be rewarded for their efforts by the temple, and Ev that the temple can probably help figure out whatever information she was hoping to gain from Barclay.

Dima and Portia are unenthusiastic about this plan, but recognize that this is a lousy neighborhood and sticking together is probably wise in the short term.

Further investigation of the building reveals:

* the remains of what seems to be an infernal magic circle on the upper floor
* the tracks of a barbed demon near the circle

The party notices that the thugs seem to be unresponsive on the street below, and exit, expecting an ambush.

A band of kenku materializes, demanding the box. Combat ensues, in which two kenku escape, and the remainder are killed. The party cover the box with the robe of one of the kenku.

The party goes to the Temple of St. Milzusvius, being waylaid on the way for a small bribe (which they pay) by a city watch guard. Zirfiel presents his credentials to [Burns](/characters/burns/), the temple's gate watchman. The party surrender their weapons and enter the temple. Following standard artifact protocol, Zirfiel leads the way toward the administrative building, where his commanding officer, [Luth](/characters/luth/), works.

> ## The Legend of St. Milzusvius

> Milzusvius was born "Mirasha", an orc belonging to a large orc clan, the Green Tusks, based in the hill country north of Waterdeep. Raised to revere Gruumsh, the martial head of the orc pantheon, and Luthic, his fertility-goddess mate, she quickly grew disillusioned in her teenage years.

> Her childhood interest in astronomy and natural philosophy put her at odds with the prevailing culture of the Tusks, and lead to an escalating series of conflicts with her family. The followers of St. Milzusvius believe that her powerful mind attracted the attention of Oghma, the god of knowledge, who challenged Gruumsh to a contest for Mirasha's allegiance.

> Different versions of the legend diverge at this point, and it's unclear what the contest consisted of, but the result was that Gruumsh believed he had been cheated, and Oghma claimed victory. Mirasha, offered the choice of a new god, refused to worship either, believing that reason alone was sufficient for revalation. She chose a new name, Milzusvius, and escaped her family to found an observatory in the hilltops.

> Oghma was pleased with this outcome, and worked quietly to defend the observatory from hostile forces. Students found their way to her, some of whom later founded the Temple of St. Milzusvius in Waterdeep.
