Morning: The party convenes in the refectory of the Temple of St. Milzusvius, after a series of off-screen individual episodes. They discuss the events of the previous day and the evidence gathered about House Skyless and the other noble houses of Waterdeep. Briefly:

> ## Noble House Politics of Waterdeep

> There is an set of old-power nobility in Waterdeep which make up the "top tier" of noble houses. Approximately 500 years in the past, there was a major re-shuffling of the nobility - many scions of major houses were lost, and the power structure established then has largely held until the last few decades.

> During the power re-structuring of 500 years ago, House Skyless fell from top-tier to third-tier status.

> Over the last few decades, ambitious second-tier families such as House Garland (with its banking enterprises) and House Carivi (with its commodities holdings) have risen in prominence, giving rise to consideration of non-noble ascension to the Masked Council, the traditional locus of top-tier political power in the city. This rise (and the relative decline of the formerly-undisputed power of the top-tier houses) has been disruptive to the traditional management of the city.

> According to rumours from the books of speculation the party recovered from Barclay's office desk, there are long-standing connections between House Skyless and the infernal hierarchy of the Nine Hells.

Zirfiel and Ev discuss the significance of Barclay's correspondence with his sister. Portia and Dima agree that the mystery of the Skyless-Devil connection seems worth investigating, but want first to handle their outstanding business with House Garland. The party agrees to head to a waterfront district, to the nearest House Garland branch office.

After a quick stop at a local market to procure minor equipment upgrades, very sexy armor, ammunition and material components, the party heads to the waterfront, taking a circituitous path. They notice:

* an angry, but seemingly non-violent street protest, perhaps related to the deteriorating quality of municipal solid waste collection services. Ev gets a good look at the rabble-rouser in chief.
* a surprising preponderance of street cats, which seem upon inspection to be non-magical and not-particularly-interested in the party (which remembers hearing lots of cats in the sewer grates into which the surviving Kenku fled the day before). This, perhaps, bodes ill...

On the way to the Garland branch office, Dima stops by a bowyer's shop and commissions an upgraded bow with the Ettercap silk gathered in the Cooperstown river valley. The bowyer tells Zirfiel that there is an expert weaponsmith named Sheesa Keenwind in the Sunken City (?) who would be able to "silver" weapons. The bow crafting is estimated to be a five-day job.

Ev does something surreptitious during the walk; no-one notices.

The party crosses a weirdly-clean stretch of road by the docks, which is being studiously avoided by local folk. Ev throws some trash into the water, and barely escapes a barbed tentacle that darts out of the water.

At the Garland branch office, Portia and Dima cash in their pork futures, and the party all open bank accounts (it's unwise to carry around more than 50 gold in cash). The clerk hires the party to clear an otyugh from the nearby sewers, in exchange for a 1000-gold line of credit from House Garland.

> ## Dark Days for Waste Management

> Among the casualties of the former power structure in Waterdeep is a reliable system of trash collection. The top-tier noble families previously maintained trash disposal facilities centered around the prodigious appetites of otyughs, aberrant beasts able to keep up with huge flows of city garbage.

> As services broke down in the wake of the rise of second-tier families, the otyugh-keepers have often suspended their activities, and free-roaming otyughs, seeing sustenance, have become threats to life and limb in several neighborhoods.

The party enters the sewers and scouts the tunnels, finding a mimic and a pile of blood-stained trash in an underground room, underneath a ladder and trapdoor. They spy the local otyugh slinking around a corner, and Ev manages to hit it with a surprise crossbow bolt. Combat ensues, and the party defeats the otyugh with a stylish divine smite from Portia. Two remaining mimics, having unsuccessfully attempted to dine on yak, flee through a sewer grate into the harbor. With further inspection and scouting, the party discovers:

* a sealed map case. The map, when examined, contains notes on individuals (the only one the party can decipher is a description of the now-dead Barclay), a large "S" near Barclay's office, and a set of "E" markings, with door glyphs, at sites spread around the northeast of the office, in neighborhoods of varying lousiness.
* the not-very-recent remains of a few more otyughs
* another ladder-and-trapdoor room, this one with less evidence of grisly goings-on.
* glorious cash
* a small box with the emblem of the Rolling Bones. Portia deftly snags it and presents an excellent poker face.


The party heads back to House Garland, presents evidence of mission success, and opens the promised line of credit.
