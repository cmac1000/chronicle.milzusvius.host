Investigating the warehouse they find themselves in, our protagonists discover, in addition to the infernal teleportation circle they used to arrive:

* Crates of fine wool marked with the symbol of House Skyless
* An adjoining office, seemingly disused for some time, containing a ledger of cloth shipments and some original research on the history of the House, focused on the period coinciding with the upheaval that transformed the House's fortunes

[Dima](/characters/dima/), chuckling behind his mustache, rigs up a complicated trap involving rope, a hunter's trap, and flasks of holy water, intended to give a bad time to the next fiends who try to use this teleportation circle. After sweeping the interesting-looking historical research into a bag (along with a nice-looking bolt or two of cloth), the party unlatches the warehouse gates, shuts it behind them, and sets off in the direction of the Temple of St. Milsuzvius.

The city is quiet in the early-morning light, shambling drunks making their way to points of refuge and occasional delivery carts wheeling past. As the party approaches the block containing the concealed temple, things get unusually deserted, and [Portia](/characters/portia/)'s unerring sense of undead presence lights up. The party sweeps into nearby alleys and creeps up the street, finding a legless skeleton dragging itself down a narrow corridor. It makes a half-hearted swing at [Zirfiel](/characters/zirfiel/) as he approaches, then goes still as Zirf presents the House Skyless epaulet acquired from the Sunken City wight, seeming to accept Zirfiel as a superior officer. Working out a system by which the skeleton taps once for yes, twice for no, the party establishes:

* The skeleton's mission was unsuccessful
* It's willing to rejoin the mission, given the apparent arrival of reinforcement
* It is decidedly not interested in "resting"

Hoisting the skeleton like a makeshift backpack, Zirfiel leads the team stealthily down the street, following the skeleton's remaining, pointing arm. As they approach the gates of the temple, they see scattered bones and weapons lying around in the street, which is otherwise deserted. Zirfiel asks the skeleton to point the way to the "rest of the team", and it, somewhat forlornly, points at the shattered remnants of the other skeletons. Nodding, Zirfiel lays it in the street, ordering it to remain in position for further orders. Portia notices that the sigil of House Skyless on the skeleton's bandolier seems to be radiating quite a bit of evil magic.

Zirfiel approaches the gate and gives the customary entry knock of temple members. A bleary-eyed [Burns](/characters/burns/), his head wrapped in an elaborate bandage, peers through the gate and lets the team in, glowering at the skeleton propped up against the nearby street corner. Portia, smoothly and with a practiced grace, sweeps off the skeleton's skull and retrieves its bandolier before joining Dima and [Ev](/characters/ev/) in entering the temple courtyard.

The courtyard contains further evidence of combat, with the shattered remains of the unworthy dead being carefully swept up by temple acolytes in need of sleep.

"Rough night, Burns?" Zirfiel asks, watching a temple cleric check the bandages on a burly acolyte's forearm.

"You could say that," acknowledged Burns grimly, leaning heavily on his battered quarterstaff, "Earthquake, and then here they come. Wasn't sure we'd hold them, but the juniors made me proud."

He claps a passing acolyte on the shoulder, and coughs, wincing, regretting the sudden movement.

Zirfiel lays a hand on Burns, mumbles the incantation while making a complicated gesture. Burns goes still, then straigtens up, color going back into his gray face. He smiles.

"Appreciate that, son. Come back later if you'd like a coffee. [Luth](/characters/luth/)'ll be wanting to see you."

Ev starts surrendering her always-surprising collection of concealed weaponry, but Luth waves her away and walks off to check on a fragile-looking junior cleric, carrying his staff lightly.

"Bad scene, team," Zirfiel acknowledges to the party, "Never seen hostiles make it through the gate. Let's have a word with the boss."

On the way to Luth's office, Zirfiel passes a small group of senior Special Tasks officers, nodding professionally to him, and looking set on a recently-acquired mission.

The party debriefs with Luth, reporting almost everything they'd recently seen: the sunken city, the further evidence of Skyless-Devil cooperation, the encounter with [Galrach](/characters/galrach/) and the demons in the depths. Zirfiel elides the coincidence of the yak bell's cracking with the earthquake. Luth nods, taking careful notes, and thanks the party for their work.

The party gets some sleep, and has several interactions:

* Zirfiel talks with Luth privately, discussing the increased security measures for the phylactery, the recent death of the acolyte formerly tasked with guarding it, and its increased magic activity. Luth has dispatched the Special Tasks team to apprise some of the noble houses of recent events. Trouble seems to be brewing elsewhere as well: farmers are streaming into the city, fleeing some unknown horror in the countryside, and more of these wights seem to have begun operating in a derelict region of the city's Southeast.
* Ev speaks with the archives department, offering the intelligence gathered from the Skyless offices. The archives department happily accepts.
* Portia has a conversation with Luth about the Order of the Rolling Bones, confirming that they have a reputation for occasionally getting too closely involved with House politics.
* Dima speaks with the chief archivist, temporarily handing over the damaged bell for study. The archivist seems interested in the Great Yak, consulting his tomes to confirm that Yak worship was once widespread in the East, but the religion largely died out some centuries back.

Dima and Portia, at long last, cash in their pork belly futures to Derell Garland, who promptly pays face value and encourages them to get in touch for future security work. Flush with cash, Portia and Dima acquire quite a nice little apartment in a fourth-floor walk-up, with easy roof access. Dima wastes no time rigging up a block-and-tackle system to haul Bobik to and from the roof, where they sleep, happily, under the city stars. Zirfiel dispels the evil magic suffusing the skeleton's sigil and bandolier, and Portia tucks it, in a little box, under a loose floorboard.

The party get quite drunk, celebrating their return to safety, and set forth early the next morning to investigate the wight activity in the Southeast.
