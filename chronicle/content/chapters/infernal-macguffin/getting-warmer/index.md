Once Rogoma recovers a bit, the party decides to head onward to try and find [Norah](/characters/norah/), the sister of [Barclay](/characters/barclay/) Skyless who might have more information on what went so wrong with the Skyless job.

They head to a nearby travel tube, and one-by-one whisk down to to third level. Here, the street is quieter, and there are more abandoned buildings - old elvish writing is visible on some of the signs, mostly scratched out or covered up with a newer language, unknown to any of our heroes.

Heading down the street in the direction Rogoma recommended, the party passes an elderly human woman. She gives [Zirfiel](/characters/zirfiel/) a quizzical smile:

"Do you know what you have, young man? Do you know its value?"

Zirfiel bluffs and plays it cool, but doesn't really know what she means. In a short conversation, he gets a strong feeling that she is very unlikely to be human, and she lets slip that she's been around for a few hundred years, "this time."

Guessing, he proffers the book of infernal conspiracy theories he picked up at Barclay's, which the woman takes with great pleasure and reverence, before returning a gift of a rolled parchment. She quickly absorbs herself in the book while Zirfiel scrutinizes the parchment he's received.

In response to his vague, spoken-aloud questions, lines of ink spiderweb across the document, forming a crisp and seemingly accurate map of the city level, with travel tubes (including some seemingly-hidden ones) picked out in light blue. Trying his luck, Zirfiel asks, "where is it dangerous?" and the entire map turns deep red - after a moment, the color shifts, and as the red fades certain sectors glow longer than others.

The map happily points the way to Norah's shop, and the party heads that way, skirting red-glowing areas with some caution.

Norah, when they find her, seems to be a moderately prosperous dealer in magical goods - [Portia](/characters/portia/) takes a long look at some clay pots filled with a constant buzzing. After a few minutes of small talk and poking at the wares, [Ev](/characters/ev/) speaks up:

"Well Norah, we're actually here to talk about your brother."

Norah visibly stiffens at this and turns, "You know Barclay?"

Not-very-tactfully, Ev lets Norah know that Barclay hired her for a recovery job, which went fine (at which [Dima](/characters/dima/) lets out an audible harumph), but delivery failed due to Barclay's unexpected exploding. Hearing of her brother's death, Norah seems distraught (although perhaps not shocked), and lets slip the name "[Galrach](/characters/galrach/)!"

She seems to oscillate between despair and a determination to begin a one-woman revenge-against-the-devils story arc - Zirfiel and Ev convince her that starting a war with the devils is unlikely to go well. She asks what the party suggests instead, and Ev tells her that if she'll be patient, our protagonists will do a bit of fact-finding, and see if they can come up with anything more concrete. She seems to find this persuasive, especially with Portia nodding sagely over her chainmail.

Portia's great at that hero stuff.

Norah gives her one of those weird wasp jars, no charge.

Heading out to find a nearby inn for a well-earned snooze, Zirfiel leans on Ev a bit.

"So why, my good Ms. Darvish, are you so interested in tracking down the perpetrators of our Barclay's sticky fate? What, as they say, is our angle here?"

Ev seems a bit taken aback.

"Well...one less devil in the world would be a good thing..."

Zirfiel nods companionably, stroking his fine infernal horns and swishing his tail about gently.

"No doubt! Bad chaps, devils. Awful lot of them around, though, when you get right down to it - if you really want to get into the devil-hunting game, you've got to really lean into it, you know? Sort of a long-term career."

Ev lets this one pass.

"So I might be inclined to wonder," Zirfiel sails on, "knowing you to be a Serious Customer and a Smart Cookie, why you would decide that taking on the diabolical hierarchy is, strictly speaking, the best of our options. Instead of, for example, heading to the surface and seeking gainful employment."

Ev lets that one go too, for a long minute, and then sighs.

"The devils are tied up with the noble families, right? That's what the books say? Barclay was my way in - I'd do this job, he'd owe me a favor, I'd work my way up. Barclay is gone; I need another way in."

A pause.

"I'm...looking for someone, and I think I need to get access to one of the big houses to find him."

Portia perks up, knowing a noble quest when she hears one.

"Hey sister!" she says, "You don't need to mess around with the devils if you want to talk to the nobles - Dima and I have connections all over town."

Dima's eyes dart suspiciously about.

Portia continues, "Who are you looking for, anyway?"

Ev straightens up and peers at an unspecific point on the rooftops, and mutters something about that being her business.

Zirfiel gives Ev a gentle tail-poke: "Too late for that, my dear. No secrets among devil-hunters."

Ev's shoulders drop, after a few seconds, and she quietly says, "my brother."

Portia gives her a big hug: "There you go! All right!"

Ev is obviously un-used to receiving hugs from armored halflings, but it's the kind of thing you grow into.
