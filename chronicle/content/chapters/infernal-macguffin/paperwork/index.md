Our protagonists descend into the lower depths of the sunken city. The signage is older, here - Elvish, [Zirfiel](/characters/zirfiel/) thinks, though he can't read it, covered with something else. Floating lights twinkle in the middle distance, and a curved road spirals along the outer wall of the cavern, disappearing into darkness.

No one seems to be around.

As our heroes discuss the best way forward, the twinkling lights seem to draw closer, until one of them floats evenly with [Ev](/characters/ev/). After a long, strange moment, it seems to come to a conclusion and zaps her with some otherworldy force, and the party falls to combat, sending charms and arrows into the evasive spheres. It's a strange, quiet battle, interrupted by the appearance down the road of a pair of gaunt figures, clutching antique swords. Muttering in gutteral, antiquated Common, the wights join the fight, one fleeing after his companion goes down under the hooves of Bobik.

Investigating the fallen wight, the party discovers an ancient epaulet - the symbol is unmistakably that of House Skyless.

Descending down the long, curving ramp, the party come to a broken section - just before the road falls away into the dark, a light shines from a doorway cut into the side wall. Composing himself, Zirfiel leads the way, strumming an old Infernal anthem on his lute. The party is greeted at the door by a pair of imps, tapping their little impish toes, and a bearded devil with a large guestbook.

The party introduce themselves and ask to see [Galrach](/characters/galrach/), a barbed devil who is quite clearly sitting at a large desk at the end of the hallway. Zirfiel leads the entryway devil, briefly, in a performance of another Infernal standard, and disingenously (but convincingly) praises his performance. After a punctilously observed bureaucratic sequence of appointment-making, inter-office communications, and waiting in small antechambers, the party finds their way to the boss.

Zirfiel's been rehearsing this in his mind, and decides that he has two objectives:

* Hide the existence of the phylactery
* Get information about the devils' goals and activities

Figuring that he needs some cover story and reason to be talking to the infernals, he decided that he'll play up the [Barclay](/characters/barclay/) Skyless connection, pretend that the expedition to the barrows was a failure, and act as if he and Ev, finding their immediate management dead, decided to follow the corporate hierarchy and report in to his superior. He unspools this narrative fluidly, easily, and entirely unconvincingly, because Galrach already knows, somehow, about the phylactery. A bit of a cloud appears over the conversation, as Galrach dispenses with sucesssive layers of flimflam.

Meanwhile, [Portia](/characters/portia/) is poking around in an adjoining chamber, which is floor-to-ceiling with filing cabinets. She rifles through one, and withdraws a document, written in Infernal, with important-looking seals and stamps. She smoothly stuffs the document into her armored pants, and Zirfiel notices Galrach glance suddenly at a corner of his desk. He coughs, significantly, but Portia continues to play it cool.

As Portia re-enters the main room, Galrach fixes her with a beady eye and summons a few devilish goons. He demands the immediate return of the stolen contract. Portia, maintaining unrelenting eye contact, allows nature to take its course, soaking the document in at-least-somewhat-holy water, and Galrach draws himself to an enraged standing position. Diplomacy is quickly breaking down, here.

Galrach announces, slowly and menacingly, that he's been lied to and stolen from, and recompense is clearly in order. He looks around, seeing the silver yak bell dangling from [Dima](/characters/dima/)'s belt.

"Let's have a look at that bell - that seems like a good start."

Dima goes still, and a smile crosses his face swiftly, like an antelope on the plains.

"Would you like to see what it can do?"

He raises the bell and brings it down sharply. It lets out an unusually discordant note, and several things happen quite quickly:

* An earthquake shakes the cavern, throwing several devils off their feet
* The silvery bulk of the Great Yak surges through the hallway, bowling over Galrach and one of his goons
* The bell shudders as a deep crack appears in it

A chaotic combat ensues, with Galrach and Zirfiel exchanging insults and spells, Portia, Dima and Bobik fending off the attacking devils and imps, and Ev finding her way to clean firing lines. As the battle seems to be going against the devils, thudding footsteps resound from the outer ground, and the shoulders of a massive demon block the doorway.

Galrach, taking advantage of the confusion, ducks into a side door and out of sight. The remaining devils, clearly outmatched, don't seem inclined to die defending the filing cabinets, and follow their leader in the retreat.

Our heroes follow as the demon, flanked by his Abyssal spawn, advances up the hallway, his flaming whip crackling. Finding the side door leads to a room with two summoning circles, one marked "Home" and one marked "Field Office" in infernal script, the party dash to the "Field Office" circle and teleport away, finding themselves in a dusty warehouse.
