Having cleared the local sewers of the otyugh threat, our heroes decide to further investigate the mysterious map they've obtained.

Ascertaining the rough direction of the nearest door glyph, they leave the waterfront behind, as the sun dips lower in the sky. Crossing a warehouse district, they come across the protest leader they'd encountered on the way in, receiving some rough treatment from some city watchmen. With a series of illusions, they convince the guards that a small dragon is crunching its way towards them, and scare them into fleeing. They leave the man, Aeo Goldwatcher, behind.

[Portia](/characters/portia/) lays hands on the battered activist, restoring him to coherence. He explains that the city watch doesn't take kindly to unauthorized civil demonstrations, expressed gratitude for the help, and tells the party to look him up if they ever need a hand. Aeo cautiously departs to find safety among his confederates.

The party heads on, and finds that the map's first door glyph refers to a barbershop in a nice little commercial district. Various attempts at stealth and persuasion suggest that the building has a well-locked back room, but do not gain our heroes entry. However, they do receive a pretty rad blue hairpiece, a fashionable haircut, yak highlights, and some batted eyelashes. While waiting for the barbershop to close for another attempt at cracking the secret, they decide to check out the next nearest glyph.

This one yields entry rather more easily: on inspection, a blank brick wall reveals an archway and a raised brick. When pressed, it reveals a riddle: "I have a head, I have a tail, I lack a body. What am I?"

"Anyone have a coin?" says [Ev](/characters/ev/), and a slot appears - on the insertion of a gold piece, the archway opens, revealing an ancient stone passage. The party ducks in before it closes, and heads into the darkness.

A side tunnel reveals a steep drop and a haze of spiderwebs - peering at it momentarily, the group lets out a collective "nah", and follows the main tunnel until it opens up to reveal a subterranean promenade, arcing out in both directions. Glowing lights hover above, and the street is thronged with humanoids bustling about their business. Crossing to a gap in the buildings on the far side of the street, our heroes gaze out into the Sunken City:

Star-like lights twinkle far above, on an enclosing stone dome. The sweeping, cavernous walls defined below it are ringed at intervals with lighted streets, joined irregularly by glowing tubes, in which can be glimpsed denizens floating up or down between the levels. Bats, birds, and smug-looking robed figures fly from point to point, making deliveries and sending information. As the levels descend, the lights thin - deep darkness is all that can be seen yawning below.

It's a hell of a thing.

After realizing their pockets have been picked a few times, the party tightens up and heads, at random, in a direction along the promenade. Their lead, such as it is, is to find a pawn-shop owner named Nora, who was mentioned in [Barclay](/characters/barclay/) Skyless' correspondence. A few encounters:

* [Zirfiel](/characters/zirfiel/) attempts to cash in on an apparent case of mistaken identity from a star-struck young gnome, but succeeds mostly in getting lightly robbed.
* Hannah Mitz, a purveyor of questionably-magical items, invites the party and begins a sales routine. Zirfiel leans way into it, expressing great admiration for an unusably-large greataxe. In a disorienting bit of conversational judo (aided by thaumatalurgial special effects), Zirf leads Hannah into a probing conversation on the merits of fiat currency, the ethics of working within the mercantile structure, and the unknowability of post-revolutionary systems of exchange. At the end of their conversation, Zirfiel has acquired a fine dueling rapier, and Hannah has a lot to think about.

Further down, the party recognizes a weapon-shop that the surface bowyer recommended. It's owned by Rogoma, a halfling artisan. The party purchases some weapon silvering and magical ammunition before the lights suddenly flicker out and Rogoma jumps over a low counter, slamming a metal screen down. An abyssal scream approaches, shrieking about a weapon sale, and a tattered, sinewy form appears behind the counter, throwing Rogoma against the wall with a powerful claw.

Unhestitatingly, Portia misty-steps through the barrier, interposing herself between the shadow demon and its prey; radiant light bursts forth as her morningstar smites into the fiend. Shrieking in pain, it flees through the screen and closed window into the street outside, but there is no escaping the righteous vengeance of the diminutive paladin: she deftly palms a healing potion into the hands of Rogoma, finds the button to open the screen, and vaults the counter in a single athletic movement, threading through her companions like a silvery guided missile. Radiance bursts forth again as the morningstar crashes into the demon.

The party springs into action, helping finish off the fiend and a pair of tiny quasits who arrived to help. A recovering Rogoma gets the lights back on and peers out over the counter.

"Pretty weird!" is the consensus view.
