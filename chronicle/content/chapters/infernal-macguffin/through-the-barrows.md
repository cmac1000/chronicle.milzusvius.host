Dima, Portia and Rael make it to the coast, where a vessel awaits to receive the Cooperstown pork shipment. Rael negotiates passage as a navigator, and leaves Dima and Portia to cross overland.

Dima and Portia head north up the trade road to Waterdeep, meeting a travelling half-orc who trades for some ammunition and lets them know that they'll soon be passing the Barrows, an area with dangerous magic and artifacts (although the road is usually safe).

As Dima and Portia cross the Barrows, they hear a commotion and encounter Ev and Zirfiel, running from a band of the undead with a large, mysterious box.

> ## The Skyless Job

> Ev, a freelance "acquirer of goods" in Waterdeep, accepted a job from a minor nobleman named Barclay Skyless to recover a "family heirloom" from the Barrows. She enlisted Zerfiel, her sometime collaborator and Oghman investigator, to help.

> Upon locating and recovering the "heirloom", an old, bulky, and dusty sealed box, Ev and Zerfiel were attacked by the vengeful dead. Recognizing a bad scene when they saw one, they seized the box and hightailed it back to the road.

Dima and Portia, though unimpressed by the fleeing pair, help fight off the skeletons and agree to head together towards Waterdeep.

The party comes to a trading crossroads, which is unusually empty. Investigating the scene, Zerfiel triggers a "bear trap" which summons a large, confused bear, which is immedately assassinated by Ev, laying low on a nearby rooftop.

Sunega, a gnome berserker, appears, leading a team of thugs wearing Zhentarim insignia, and demands the box. Zerfiel's negotiation skills don't accomplish much other than earning him a shield bash to the face, and combat begins.

As the party fights the Zhentarim team, another group of skeletons appear behind them and reach the box, which grants them unusual strength and focus. Zerfiel convinces Sunega that the party will give her the box if they'll help fight the skeletons; Sunega agrees and leads the attack. When she reaches the box, Zerfiel casts suggestion, convincing her for the next eight hours that the box "belongs in a museum". The combined parties then defeat the undead.
