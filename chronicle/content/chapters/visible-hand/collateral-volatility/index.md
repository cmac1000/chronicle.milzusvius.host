As predicted, [Dima](/characters/dima/) finds the trail easily. Silently pointing out broken twigs and scattered gravel, he stalks into the sheltering firs. After a moment, his companions join him. Soon, the scents of woodsmoke, livestock and tilled earth fade, replaced by juniper and sage. Birds rustle through the distant canopy, and a sense of hushed alertness slowly permeates the air.

> When summer in the mountains gains its peak,

> When gaily blooming flowers begin to fade,

Dima's mind, in times like these, moves gently. Slowly, calmly; the shape of a place is like a skittish colt. Approach it directly, and it will buck - move indirectly, without urgency, and let it find you.

> When nomads from the sunshine refuge seek

> Beside a rapid river, in a glade,

There. That one's moving wrong.

Walking some distance behind, [Portia](/characters/portia/) and [Rael](/characters/rael/) see Dima freeze, for an instant, and vanish. Hurrying up, they see him flat behind a log, gesturing for silence and stillness, and they nod and comply. Slowly, slowly, Dima finds a gap, and raises up, arrow drawn, to find...

A toad, silent and staring, perched on a rock, thirty feet distant. Dima and the toad regard each other, and Dima knows, to his core, that it's deeply wrong. Shouldn't be here, shouldn't be acting this way. Dark magic.

Rael steps out and approaches the toad, which shifts its toady eyes to her. She reaches out...

-- *What are you doing here? What are you?* --

And feels the thing's surprise and attention. She feels it understand, and see her more clearly.

"Down!" shouts Dima, as the arrow hums across the clearing - and the toad is gone. Rael saw it jump, she thinks, but...were there wings, for a moment? And then nothing, just blank rock.

Dima, muttering, retrieves his arrow.

Portia stretches out her divine sense. They'd practiced, once, on some artifacts that the Bones kept for the purpose. Celestials, undead, elementals...

"Fiend," she says, with a grim certainty. "That was a fiend."

---

Further, now. It's quiet here, the distant susurration of insects.

-- **thwack** --

A stubby arrow, vibrating against a tree trunk, inches from Rael's head. She snaps her arm up and sends an answering blast, but the goblin is quick, and already on another branch. His partner leaps down to finish the job, curved blade glinting - but Portia's already there, shield pushing him back, her morningstar whirring home...

The ambushing goblins defeated, the party discovers a concealed campsite. Lots of goblinoid tracks, the remains of last night's fire pit, cast-off plunder not worth hauling home - this is a raiding camp.

Rael studies the stones around the pit, long after she's done looking for goblin clues. There's something about the ellipse they're shaped in...something significant...

Her hands quick and quiet, she moves each stone. This one here, this one here, better like this. As she places the last stone in the spiral, time seems to stop, the forest snapping into crystalline clarity.

And for a moment, she feels it all, and she is everything: the squirel exhaling in the small tree, the robin gliding in for a landing on that branch, the roots, grasping downward. She feels the lines of force, taut and flexing, lacing reality, and she knows that she is being shown something - some sliver of the knowledge that her patron swims through, the geometry of possibility.

She blinks, and the moment is gone. Dima, watching her eyes return to focus, tugs on his mustache. Dark magic.

---

It's getting cooler as the elevation climbs, and the goblin trail is becoming more defined.

Step, step, from rock to root; find the quiet path, leave no trace. Dima's eyes are straining in the leave-dappled light, and that toad's got him checking every stone they pass. A fiend? Bad business, whatever it -

*snap*

He should have seen it, he realizes later, he's made the same trap before himself. A simple snare and counterweight, and a springy tree branch. In an instant, it catches him around the ankle and he's lifted, upside down, swaying above the head of the astonished Portia. A bell on the other side of the tree tinkles loudly, and Dima curses as only a man raised near a slag heap can curse, wrestling his way out to land, flat, once more on the ground.

A trapper. Smart, but maybe not that smart - aha, there he comes. Loud fellow. We've got a minute or so, let's see if we can't prepare a welcome...

---

Later, massaging an injured thigh and regarding the heavy corpse of the vanquished ogrillon, he glowers at Rael.

"Let's get straight. When monster comes out of woods with axe, wanting to eat handsome ranger, you have job: you blast, you turn to stone, or something. Not make friends."

There's something about elf shoulders that gives their shrugs great eloquence. It's partially physical but largely cultural, and as the product of an elven society Rael can communicate a great deal with the gesture. This particular shrug suggests a certain amount of regret for recent events, but also the importance of living for the future, and not dwelling on the past.

"What's that clearing?" Portia asks.

Dima picks up his bow with rather more force than necessary and stalks over.

The trees do seem to thin at the top of that hill...and there's something about it, now that they look closer. The air seems clearer there, somehow, the pine needles a deeper green. As Dima leads the ascent, he feels his anger dissapating, replaced by a buoyancy in his soul.

A simple stone circle stands at the center of the clearing. The party peers closely - there's power here, but not of a kind readily identifiable. The stone itself looks natural, but very old, and the rock is wrong for this area - a bright feldspar against the dull granite of the hills.

There's a figure carved into it, Portia realizes, but it's not one she recognizes. Curved horns, looks like, small eyes...

"The Yak," says Dima, with a deep satisfaction. He plants his feet and cups his hands over his mouth. The low, long grunt starts quiet, but rises and reverberates across the valley, echoing against the hillsides.

Portia and Rael exchange a look. After two days of fastidious stealth, this display seems out of character.

Dima listens as the sound ripples across the valley, a slow fade back to silence. He waits, listens, for a sign.

There, finally - movement. Purposeful, fast - two at least. Riders, by the look of it, coming down from the mouth of the mountain.

Hunters.

Dima turns to his companions, a fierce smile across his face.

"They're coming."
