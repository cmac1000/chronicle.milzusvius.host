The sun shines brightly over the Querulous Woodsman as a slim figure approaches. Their features are fine, even strangely beautiful, but something unidentifiable glints behind their eyes.

[Rael](/characters/rael/) casts an appraising look down the empty trade road, the fork in the road labelled "Cooperstown", and the mute evergreens rustling beyond. After a long moment, she seems to come to a decision, and walks swiftly into the inn.

Telford Quinn rarely gets many guests, but he's always happy to see a paying customer (and he got two already this week!) He's unclear, yet, if this one qualifies. This young...man, he decides.

"Morning! Can I get you something?"

Rael tries for a seltzer, and as confusion spreads like nightfall over Telfor's face, quickly switches her order to a beer. Whistling, he pours one out.

Two travellers appraise her from a table near the stairs - one politely, bright eyes over glinting chainmail, and one darkly, stubble and a flourishing mustache over an early ale.

Rael slides a few coppers over, accepts her beer and calmly places it, without looking, on the scarred bartop. "I don't suppose there's any work to be had in Cooperstown?" she asks. Telford thoughtfully regards one in a long line of unwashed mugs before replying.

"You know, funny you should ask. Usually, this time of year, your best bet would be to ask around at the docks in town - it's almost caravan time, and there's usually work for hired hands packing up the shipment."

"This year, though, I hear tell there's call for mercs - gerblins up in the hills, they say, and Carivi's worried they might try for the boats. Bet she pays well, too, that pork's not cheap."

Seeing Rael's interest, he nods.

"If you're headed that way, you might talk to those two."

He raises his voice a bit:

"Is that right? Ya'll heading into the valley as well?"

The tall one's eyes flick to the door, and his face betrays nothing. Rael gets the strong sense that he has a very accurate mental map of the exits from the room, and knows exactly which ones he could get through before an assailant.

After a moment, the armored halfling pokes him in the ribs and stands up.

"Might be. Might be taking that goblin contract."

She gives Rael's slim frame an appraising look.

"But I think we've probably got all the muscle we need."

Behind her, the human ranger twirls his mustache.

"Muscle's not my specialty," says Rael. "But if you're heading into those woods, you'll need more than a strong arm. Let me show you something..."

She casts around for a suitable target - in a dark corner, a rat is quietly getting around a week-old crust of bread. Good enough, she decides, and lets her mind relax into a more receptive state.

The light dims for her as she focuses her attention on the rat. The lines appear, as the always do, etching themselves into her awareness. They radiate at strange angles from unknown points, curving around the bartender, the halfling, the ranger - the rat. They flex, softly, and then more strongly as she imposes her mind onto them.

The lines are so easy to see, once she learned how, that it still amazes her than no one else seems to know about them.

One hand stretches forth, and the rat looks up.

The other hand in a pocket, wrapping around a curved shape. It's cold, today, but the shell responds to her as it always does, and across the great distance, she feels the crashing waves of His mind.

The lines snap together into a new shape, an unreadable sigil of force and will, and a violet crackle streaks from Rael's hand...

And sails into the wall, leaving a burning smell and eliciting an enraged shriek from the rat, which darts towards its assailant, giving her a vicious bite.

Grimacing, Rael kicks the rat off, whirls and refocuses - this time the blast strikes true, propelling the rat across the hall to land with a dull thud.

The ranger is on his feet, his hand on the handle of a holstered shortsword. "Dark magic," he mutters.

The halfling smiles and waves him down.

"Never hurts to have a good blaster at your side, [Dima](/characters/dima/)."

She streches out a hand.

"I'm [Portia](/characters/portia/) Foggsgate, paladin cadet, Rolling Bones. This is Dima. If you're interested, you're welcome to join us."

Rael smiles, cautiously, and accepts the firm handshake. "Rael," she says, "and I'm ready to go."

Telford looks from Rael's untouched beer to the blasted rat and nods: "That might be best."

Dima sees most things, walking under the vaulted sky. As Portia and Rael discuss the local economy of the area and rehearse their knowledge of goblin culture, he turns his attention outward, and lets [Karagandan verse](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Summer_(Abay)) run through his mind.

> The geese fly, honking through the cloudless skies.

It's close, here - the trees are the tallest he's seen yet in his journey from the Eastern steppe. He runs his hand across the curve of his bow, unconsciously. A bird, there.

> The ducks skim noiselessly across the river,

It's strange that the Yak would call him here - so far from home. Stranger still that he would find himself in the company of a small paladin and...whatever the other one is. A fox, under that log.

> The girls set up the felt tents, slim and spry,

But the Yak did call him here, of this there can be no doubt. The dreams are strong and getting stronger. Woodsmoke, now...farms ahead.

> As coy and full of merriment as ever.

A shout. Fear, anger...trouble.

A farmer rushes out: "Please help!"

Portia smoothly intercepts him and gets the situation: unknown attackers have barricaded themselves in his barn. Can these travellers help?

Portia, recognizing a civilian in need, quickly agrees - Dima makes some pointed inquiries about payment, and the farmer promises compensation in silver. Satisfied, the party creeps toward the building.

It's solidly built, seems shut tight and no sound comes from within. Dima takes up a position behind a larch beech, within bowshot of the main door; Rael and Portia slip around the side to scout the back.

Rael pauses to manifest a tangible force, which prods exploratorily at the front door without sucess.

As Portia rounds the corner, she catches the brief sight of a tin-helmeted head, which swiftly withdraws back into a rear window. She rolls her shoulders, draws a morningstar, and signals Rael for a boost. On her whistle, Rael lifts her up and through the window and Dima fires an experimental arrow into the door latch, which vibrates but holds firm. Portia lands on her feet, and finds herself in a silent, dusty wooden room. Low walls block vision, the end of the hallway seems entirely blocked by disorderly farm equiment.

Portia rounds the corner to discover a crouching figure with bared teeth and a drawn scimitar, who lunges at her with a desparate attack. Rael and Dima, meanwhile, are hammering at the front door with arrows and psychic force. The door, which after all was meant to block nothing stronger than chickens, quickly succumbs to this onslaught, and the pile of crates blockading it scatter.

Light pours into the barn, swiftly followd by more arrows as Dima finds his targets. The goblin goes down under the combined attack, but another appears, firing a shortbow from a dark stall. Dima can't get a shot, and Rael finds herself face to face with the creature.

She reaches out, mind-to-mind, and opens a channel. The goblin, having heretofore communicated entirely in Goblin, is stunned to find Raels wordless voice in his head, offering an unspecific deal and strongly recommending surrender. Surrender is never far from a lone goblin combatant's mind, and he finds his resolve wavering...

But it doesn't have time to waver long before Dima boosts Portia up and over the stall wall, and she comes down with great finality, morningstar-first.

As the party checks the corners of the room for further ambushers, there's a clattering from the blocked back hallway, and a larger goblin appears, briefly, in the light. He glances at the scene, and his recent warriors, and then nimbly scurries through the window.

Dima, moving quickly, makes it to the window in time to get a single shot off, which catches the goblin in the shoulder. He spins, but continues, and disappears beyond the treeline.

The farmer, Joseph Helias, thanks the party for their efforts, and does produce payment - but to their surprise, he offers not coins, but slips of paper marked with large calligraphic 'G's.

A shadow crosses Dima's face as he regards these documents. "Silver, I believe you said. And where I am from, a man's word is his bond."

"Ah, not from around here? It's a new century, my friends! If you we're in the pork game, you'd know what these are. Pork futures! Backed by the banking houses, good as gold!"

He slaps a handsome side of pork hanging from the rafters.

"Welcome to the valley!"
