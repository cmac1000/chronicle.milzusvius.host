It feels good to be in the field, finally. This is her chance.

[Portia](/characters/portia/) knows the Rolling Bones isn't the most prestigious paladin order - and she's gotten enough reactions now, travelling, to know that a lot of people suspect it isn't far removed from a mercenary company. Portia isn't worried about this - the order has always taken care of her, and it always seems to be on the right side of the conflicts it got involved in. Well, at least not the evil side.

And she's ready. There aren't many halflings in the order, but she knows she's good. The drills, the lessons, the apprenticeship - everyone knows Portia Foggsgate works harder than anyone else. When Kragarm told her it was time to find a journeyman mission, she didn't cry, she didn't hug anyone - she just nodded, crisply, and packed.

It was lucky she'd run into [Dima](/characters/dima/) on the road. He's a good scout, a great archer and seems to run things by his own code. Completely insane, obviously (searching for a ghost yak, I think he said?) but insane in the useful, reliable way common among autodidacts who've spent too much time on the road.

As journeyman missions went, this one seems pretty good. Defend an isolated town against goblins? It's a classic! Seems like a prosperous place, too. The Bones never mind making a little money...

She realizes that the town is coming into view - a simple wooden wall framed by small farms, perched on a river. Behind it, forested hills roll off for miles, backed by distant mountains. A fair amount of road traffic, in this close - farmers bringing in sides of pork, mostly, but also the unremarkable commerce common to all market towns. Portia had been in enough country towns to tell that this one's doing all right - the kids running along the wagons look happy, the horses are healthy, and the passing farmers all looked intent on getting somewhere.

Feeling the attention her pointed ears are receiving, [Rael](/characters/rael/) calmly wraps her head in a scarf. Not many half-elves, out here. With the recent corsair trouble, elves don't tend to receive warm welcomes in places like this.

They pass through the wooden gate into town, Dima feeling, as always, the shackles of civilization closing in. It's pretty obvious which way to head to find the local government - a large fortified house dominates one side of town, across the market.

"Foggsgate!"

Portia's head snaps around to the familiar voice, and there he is. Deceptively stout, tangled black beard, Rolling Bones shield shining at his side. Lieutenant Kirnek Kragarm beams at her, hoisting a tankard of ale. Portia rushes in and meets his avuncular embrace.

"Glad ye made it, lass. Talked to the Reeve yet?"

"No sir, we just got into town."

Portia introduces her companions to Kragarm.

"Ah good, ye've done some recruiting. How you split out the reward's your affair, lass; just don't forget the Order's share."

Funny, 'the Order's share' hadn't come up before...

"I'll be here if ye need information, and to keep an eye on things. I can't lend too much of a hand, you know, but I'll be rooting for ye."

Portia nods, thanks him, and the party heads through the market. In passing, they meet:

* Derell Garland, a banking house agent down from Waterdeep
* Orion Gilbert, the head priest of the local temple of Chauntea
* Gert Quinn, the propietor of the town's inn, which Kragarm is single-handedly putting into the black.

The temple is among the more impressive structures in town, heavily decorated with a motif of plump, happy pigs. It's pretty weird, actually, the more they think about it. Portia's never liked priests, Dima prefers his gods under the open sky, and Rael doesn't strike anyone as conventionally faithful - they give the temple a miss.

At the Reeve's house, they inquire about the rumoured goblin contract. The guard, Tobias Fletcher, nods and disappears inside, reappearing a moment later to welcome the party in for tea.

Valm Carivi, Reeve of Cooperstown, greets the travellers.

"Welcome to Cooperstown! Tobias tells me you're interested in some security work."

"Yes, your grace," replies Portia, "We've heard that you're having trouble with goblins, and we'd be happy to help solve the problem."

Further conversation reveals that the recent level of goblin activity is unusual - Lady Carivi has been Reeve for about a decade, and there's never been a serious security threat like this before. In a week's time, the annual Cooperstown pork shipment is scheduled to depart for Waterdeep, and everyone knows how crazy goblins go for pork - the town would much prefer to find and neutralize the goblins before the shipment departs.

Rael shows heretofore unseen charm when the subject of payment is raised, and the lady finds herself agreeing to pay 600 gold upon proof of goblin neutralization - the charm necklace of the goblin chief is the standard evidence for this sort of thing, she's given to understand.

"Good luck to you, my friends! The town will be in your debt."

Lady Carivi rises to leave.

"Have you tried our pork yet, by the way? It's no wonder those little guys go crazy for it."
