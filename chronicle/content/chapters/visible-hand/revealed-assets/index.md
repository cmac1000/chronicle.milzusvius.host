After recovering from their injuries, the party searches the goblin cave. [Rael](/characters/rael/) investigates the stonework in the older section, pronouncing it to be very old, and likely dwarven work. The shape of this structure suggests a temple, with a long-collapsed entrance - the natural cave seems to have eroded a side wall, re-opening the chamber.

Clearing the goblinoid detritus away from the altar reveals a totem - a shaggy head, cut from stone, stares unblinking back at [Portia](/characters/portia/). It's unmistakably a yak.

Further investigation reveals small caches of silver and gold, as well as a side room full of pork barrels in various states of consumption.

Emerging once more into the light, the party heads back toward Cooperstown. An hour or so into the journey, the hairs on the back of Portia's neck stand up - quick figures are moving through the trees, just far enough out to be unidentifiable. She signals her compatriots, who look for a defensible clearing, and take up covered positions. Real hobgoblins, maybe?

After a few minutes, a tall wood elf strides into the clearing, a yew staff at her side.

"Good day, travellers. I think we have you to thank for clearing the forest of those little monsters?"

Portia straightens up, recognizing a druid when she sees one.

"Yes, ma'am. Just doing some security work for Cooperstown - I assure you, we mean the forest no harm."

The wood elf nods, her eyes briefly alighting on Rael's pointed ears, then on the curved shell in her hand, which Rael quietly pockets.

"That is well, and you are welcome among us. I am Zeno Aralamin, and I lead the circle of the yak here in the valley."

[Dima](/characters/dima/) starts, and Zeno smiles at him.

"You are the one, I think, who woke the valley with that yak call yesterday? We came when we heard."

"Is me, yes - I am Dima."

"It was a good one! I've been practicing for some years, and my yak grunts still aren't that lifelike."

She gives Dima an appraising look.

"It's no accident that you came here, I think. What is it that you seek?"

Dima seldom enjoys explaining the yak quest, but he senses a more-than-usually-receptive audience.

"Great Yak - he comes to me, in dreams. He calls, and I must answer. Each dream, a bit farther, and so I come - I saw this place. And so I came."

Zeno, unlike anyone else Dima has ever told this to, takes it seriously. She paces around the clearing.

"Multiple dreams? For how long?"

Dima considers for a moment. "Two years."

Zeno smiles. "Two years! You must have had dozens of the dreams - I only ever had three, and Arthus there had four."

Portia reflects on a strange new possible reality in which Dima is in fact a violent travelling prophet, rather than merely a violent travelling madman.

Zeno continues, "Most of us in the circle came to the valley following similar visions. He comes to one of us, once in a great while, when he has something for us to do. He like balance, we think - usually he needs us to intervene when there's something interfering from outside, when things are getting unbalanced."

Dima nods. "He comes? You have seen him?"

Zeno laughs, along with her druids. "Oh heavens no, not in person. We don't think he really exists on this plane - "

But her sentence trails off, and she focuses on something moving deep in the forest.

And suddenly, everyone can hear the softly tinkling bells, and the sunlight through the treetops takes on a strange, silvery cast. One by one, small shaggy figures nose their way out of the trees, to stand calmly, chewing pine needles or rubbing their flanks against trunks. Dima's seen dwarf yaks before, on the steppe, but these are somehow wilder-looking, though each has a silver bell on a simple loop around its neck.

Zeno stares in wonderment, then drops to one knee and bows her head. As one, the other druids follow suit.

The light brightens, and an enormous silver yak moves, inexplicably, through spaces between trees that really shouldn't allow him to pass. His great head bobs gently from side to side as he takes up a nice spot in the sunlight. A large bell fastened to his collar tolls softly, and he regards the assembled group. A wave of patience and kindness wafts over Rael, but she feels his attention pause as it sweeps over the shell in her pocket.

Dima bows, deeply, and the Great Yak shakes out his mane. A low, rhythmic grunt booms out, and it's several moments before Dima realizes that the Yak is laughing. The assembled yaks join in the laughter, which reverberates against the trees.

As it fades, the Yak turns his head to one of the small yaks around the edge of the clearing, which stops trying to chew on a nearby druid's satchel, and trots up next to him. He glances at the Great Yak next to him, who gives him an encouraging sort of head bobble, and then approaches Dima. As he does, the silver seems to drain from his fur, and his bell goes silent - he seems to solidify, somehow, and gently burrows his head against the kneeling Dima, who gives him a reassuring pat.

"Thank you, Great Yak! I am ready to serve. I will take good care of...Bobik!"

Bobik cocks his head for a moment, then starts crunching away on a tasty-looking mushroom.

The Yak seems pleased, and the silver light begins to fade. The assembled yaks bound back out into the trees, and the Great Yak turns to follow them, ambling gently. The sounds of the forest return, and Zeno, stupefied, stares out into the woods. She walks over to where the yak had stood, and bends to pick up a great silver bell.

"No clapper..." she says. She turns to Dima.

"Dima, we underestimated you! The Yak honors you greatly."

She holds out the bell.

"The circle of the yak is delighted to have you here, and we will be happy to aid you if we can."

Dima, unused to this amount of praise, accepts the bell, and takes a look at it. He's no archaeologist, but he recognizes that the bell is extremely old, and also that it's quite strange for a bell to lack a clapper.

He realizes that he's not really sure what to do, now - "follow the dreams" was a pretty good quest for a long time, and it seems like things are now getting more complicated.

Portia claps him on the shoulder (or rather the shoulder blade, she can't quite reach the shoulder).

"Congratulations, big guy! Knew you had it in you." She grins at Rael.

Rael looks around and asks, "So...back to town? To declare victory?"

Zeno nods. "Of course. Let us escort you through the woods back to Cooperstown - the forest can be dangerous."

The druids fan out into the woods, taking up flanking and scouting positions.

Zeno happily scratches Bobik behind the ears, and he responds with a pleased harumph.
