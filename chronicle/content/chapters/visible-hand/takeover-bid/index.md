Our heroes decide to make a stand on the hilltop, and get to work on fortifications. On the eastern approaches, [Dima](/characters/dima/) lays his two hunting traps. [Portia](/characters/portia/) constructs a rolling log trap, held in place by a single rope. [Rael](/characters/rael/) methodically fills glass bottles with oil, stoppers them with cloth, and arranges them in a neat row behind a boulder. She builds a small, concealed fire, careful to keep it well-separated from her makeshift molotovs.

The trio huddles together in a clump of trees and rocks near the top of the most obvious approach to the hilltop, and wait.

Below the reddening sky, a mounted figure emerges from the forest at the bottom of the hill.

"Warg-rider," whispers Dima. On the steppes, children still hear legends about the warg-rider hordes of Bruvnahx, erasing decadent civilizations from the earth until meeting the strength and cunning of the sons of Karaganda. Dima notches an arrow.

The warg sniffs the air, and paces along the treeline. The rider seems to be listening, or waiting for a signal...

From the east, a sharp yelp of surprise and pain. Dima smiles - his trap was well-laid. The rider wheels, blows a long note on his horn, and begins to trot up the hill.

Portia's hand on the lead-rope to the log-pile, counting time and distance. About 200 feet out now...at 30 feet out, in this light, he's going to spot the trap (goblins see in the dark, right?)...given log acceleration on a slope like this, the best time to hit him would be...

"Now!"

Rael arcs a burning molotov onto the oil-soaked logs as Portia severs the rope. The radiant light of the flaming logs is briefly enough for Dima to pick out a look of goblinoid surprise and confusion before warg and rider are overcome.

Miraculously, the rider emerges on his feet, lightly smoking. He points his saber at the trio and advances, as two more riders (one with a warg favoring an injured foot) emerge to the east. The hunters spring forward, and a chaotic battle is joined...

---

Dima firing arrow after arrow into the oncoming riders before being swept from his tree, and joining swords with the smoking captain.

---

Portia wheeling like a small, efficient metal demon - each hit seems to take down an opponent just before they inflict harm on one of her companions.

---

Rael insinuating herself into the mind of the youngest rider, who finds himself briefly overcome with terrifying hallucinations and unable to join the fray.

---

As the last rider falls, the surviving warg crouches and snarls before spinning and heading for the tree line. Arrow and blast miss the agile beast as he plunges into the undergrowth, beelining back to home base.

It was a close-fought battle - three wargs and riders was a difficult match. Night has fallen, and Portia helps an injured Rael onto her feet, following Dima into the woods to find a concealed spot to camp.

The next morning, feeling stronger, the party sets out to track the riders' trail back to their home base. They're not far, now, and after an hour or so's travel, they spot a cave opening, with well-worn paths and a small, solitary figure standing guard; smoke curls out of the entryway.

They discuss their options for approach - open diplomacy? Intimidation? Surprise attack?

"What do you know about goblins?" asks Rael.

The study of goblinoids is a standard subject of a Rolling Bones apprenticeship, alongside their sometime collaborators or rivals, orcs and kobolds. Protecting towns from roving bands of these characters is a reliable moneymaker for an order like the Bones, and they like to know their business thoroughly.

Portia thinks about it:

"Well, the little guys, the true goblins, are what we've seen so far. Sneaky, not very brave. Opportunistic raiders."

"Bugbears, despite the name, are neither bugs nor bears, but goblinoids in their own right. Big, hairy guys, dumb as rocks, though stealthier than you'd think."

"But it's the hobgoblins that organize things, they're the ones you need to be careful of. Single-minded bastards - give one a hundred goblins to push around, and he'll have them lined up in ranks doing pushups within a day, marching in formation within a week, and capturing villages within a year. Goblins hate them, but mostly follow orders."

Dima listens impassively. Small ones, big ones - sure. All just targets.

Rael nods slowly, "Can you describe what a hobgoblin looks like? I have an idea..."

Being the gate guard isn't such a bad deal, Cenk considers. You take those three poor saps who went out last night to check out the big hill - not a one of 'em made it back, and the warg telling some batshit story about a magic kid with pointy ears, and a leather scarecrow in a tree.

Cenk doesn't need to go out there flashing around on a warg, even if it is what all the girls like. Right here at the gate's fine, thank you - out of the rain, you usually get a taste of whatever the grabbers picked up from the farms. No trouble.

Three approaching now...tall, two of 'em. Load of armor on the little one. Halfling? Cenk reaches for the bell rope. Dumb, to attack in the open like this. Well, better start the show...wait a second, that's not a human in the lead. Oh, shit...

The hobgoblin, leading two miserable-looking prisoners, draws to a halt at the gate.

"Soldier!" he says, in common, "Surprise inspection. Where is your commander?"

"Why -", begins Cenk, in goblin.

"Don't speak that country talk here, boy! In this legion, we speak common!"

Cenk looks more closely at the hobgoblin. He hasn't seen one up close in a few years, and he could swear the ones he saw then didn't have green eyes...

The hobgoblin leans in close.

"Son, I'm going to let this insubordination pass, once. I know you boys have been out here in the field a long time. But you are going to direct me to your superior officer, immediately, or I am going to string you up on that tree," he points over his shoulder, "and I am going to find someone who can."

"Yes, sir, sorry sir!" Cenk says, in common. Who knows what the legion's up to these days? Just call 'em sir and keep your head down, they like that.

"Captain Hark is in his chambers - first left up ahead, then follow the main cave around to the right. Can't miss it, sir."

The hobgoblin straightens up.

"That's more like it, private! Carry on."

He sweeps into the cave, driving the manacled halfling and human before him. Guess that warg wasn't totally crazy after all...

---

So far, so good, Rael thinks. The hobgoblin face probbly isn't quite right, and maintaining the illusion of the armor is taking a lot of concentration, but it's amazing what an assertive voice can accomplish.

Portia gently kicks Dima, fiddling with the lightly-secured manacles around his wrists, as they enter the main cavern. Sloping tents surround a low fire covered in makeshift grills and cooking pots, a handful of puzzled goblin faces in the flickering light.

Maintaining a purposeful march, Rael keeps her eyes forward and her jaw set, pushing her 'prisoners' onward to the right, toward a narrow shaft. There's a discontinuity here in the rock - the water-worn natural passage gives way abruptly to square, hewn stonework. Rael doesn't have much time to examine it - through an open door she sees a goblin with an elaborate bone necklace look up from a charcoal map.

Alarmed, he hops down from his over-large throne, "What's all this?"

"Captain Hark, this is a field inspection. You've got a lot to explain, soldier. And you will address me in common."

Hark's eye's flicker to his attendant.

"Louie, you know anything about this?"

Louie shakes his head, eyes wide.

"At attention, Captain!" bellows Rael, "You know the code!"

Hark blinks. The code? What the hell is this? He took his boys out here to get away from all this legion bullshit - nice quiet cave, easy pickings from those human farms. How did they even find him?

"Yes, sir," he says finally, in common, "Hail the legion." Who is this jackal?

Rael pushes: "I found these two mercenaries creeping around your headquarters. Clearly, your vigilance is lacking. And what's this I hear about lost warg-riders? Trained riders aren't disposable, captain. Can you explain these lapses?" 

It's true that Rard, Crerk and Crags didn't make it back last night, and these two more or less fit Ryng's description from that dumb-ass barn grab. What a mess that was - but weren't there supposed to be three?

"Yes sir, thank you for capturing these prisoners. We'll take them from here, and I'm sure we'll have no more trouble...securing the legion's tribute."

Rael shakes her head, dolefully.

"I'm afraid not, captain; you're being demoted and relieved of your command. You are to report to the legion's regional headquarters for reassignment."

She turns smartly to Louie.

"Louie! Congratulations, private - you've been promoted."

Back to Hark:

"I will need your necklace of office, private Hark."

Hark leans forward - something's wrong here.

"I see, sir - the regional headquarters. I'll head east, then?"

Rael nods crisply, "I'm glad you understand."

Hark sees it now - some trick! Time to spring the trap.

"That's funny, because the only regional headquarters I know about is north of here."

He signals, subtly - behind Portia, Louie silently draws his sword.

Rael feels the situation slipping, and Dima tensing for combat. Lean into it, she tells herself.

"Don't try to weasel your way out of this, Hark!"

She strides forward and snatches the necklace from around his neck.

"And don't presume to know the legion's movements! We operated on a need-to-know basis, private, and headquarters is wherever it needs to be. Any further insubordination will result in a field court-martial."

She leans in, and her eyes burn behind the illusory mask:

"I advise you not to push your luck with me, son."

A long moment passes. Louie shifts his weight from one foot to the other; Portia holds her breath.

"Yes sir," says Hark at last, "my mistake. I'll head...east...then..."

Shaking his head, and moving as if in a dream, Hark steps around the prisoners, and his newly-promoted field attendent. The hobgoblins always find a way to screw up a good thing. Maybe he can grab some of the boys on the way out, head up into the hills for a while - if this blows over, come back in a couple days...

Louie's never really wanted a command position, and he's spent enough time working for hobgoblins to now that being one's captain is never an enviable position. He looks a bit closer at this one's face.

"Begging your pardon, sir, but what happened to your hair?"

Rael's eyes flick toward him, and the mask flickers, just for a moment. Louie steps back in shock.

"What - "

And Dima is up, the manacles clattering to the floor, short swords out - Louie doesn't stand a chance.

But the spell is broken, and the departing Hark spins on his heel: "Louie!"

"All right then," says Portia, dropping her own manacles and shifting her shield into position, "go to plan B."

It's a rough one - Dima goes down, unconcious, holding off a wave of attackers from the main chamber. Portia, who would ordinarily be filling the blocker role, finds herself tied up with a roaring bugbear who materializes from a dark passage to the side of the throne room. Rael is able to briefly mire the captain in a horrifying illusory reality involving a veangeful Louie, but he eventually breaks free and works, with some success, to rally his boys to a defense.

The goblins are depleted, though - they lost two in the barn, two in the ambush, three in the hilltop battle, and their lone surviving warg is in no shape for combat. The bugbear falls, the remaining goblins get picked off, and then Hark goes down shortly thereafter. Portia rushes over to the fallen Dima and lays on hands - a soft glow briefly suffuses the chamber as the worst of Dima's injuries close, and he coughs back into conciousness.

The party listen, nervously, for further movement - none comes. Rael wraps a makeshift bandage around a sprained wrist, then smiles and holds up Hark's bone necklace.

"Mission accomplished."
