Oksar Ungart was in his clan's army that marched to fight for an ally 80 years ago.

The army was losing, and instead of dying Oksar was knocked unconscious. When he awoke he was on a ship,eventually sold to the fighting pits where he was known as "The Tiny Mountain". After 50 years in the pits, his life was bought by the Smith's Guild in Watersdeep and he left to become a hired hand/strong arm for them.

He is known from his former pit days, but is easily angered when that is brought up, and also doesn't talk about anything before the pits. He is also known for literally breaking kneecaps on people who don't pay their Smithing bills on time as he sees it as disrespectful. After trapping them in his net.

The Smith's Guild has seen a rise in its profits since buying Oksar's life, and though it's been mentioned in some circles that after 30 years, the contract is almost over, no one seems to discuss it much as afterwards Oksar would in theory be free to do what he'd like (in part because Oksar doesn't seem to realize this fact).
