# Xalros (Deep Gnome Wizard)

Xalros is one of a handful of Svirfneblin living in Waterdeep, and is a researcher for the Temple of St. Milzusvius.

As a young gnome in Blingdenstone, Xalros worked with his father, a gemcutter devloping experimental techniques. Searching for rare specimens, and honing his growing arcane skills, he accompanied teams of deep gnomes into Underdark cave complexes, helping to repel attacks by marauding aberrations.

On one such expedition, the gnomes rescued a badly-wounded Milzusvian cleric, the last survivor of a failed artifact-acquisition mission. The Blingdenstone council decided it was a good time to open a line of communication with Waterdeep, so after the cleric recovered, Xalros volunteered to escort him back to the Waterdeep. 

The Milzusvians quickly recognized Xalros' arcane talents, and he accepted a research position with the archives division. He rarely enters the field these days, and spends his time quietly conducting diplomatic work for Blingdenstone, and helping the Milzusvians decipher ancient texts.
