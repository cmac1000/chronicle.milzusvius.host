The Temple of St. Milzusvius rarely recruits openly: as a cult of Oghma, a god of knowledge, the clergy considers the first test of parishioners to be deciphering the existence and location of the temple. Tieflings are seldom welcomed in human society, and from his youth Zirfiel had developed an aptitude for defensive combat and a curiosity about his origins. After exhausting the knowledge (and patience) of the city's secular researchers, Zirfiel found his way to the Milzusvians.

His talents (and infernal legacy) were quickly recognized as an asset by the temple leaders, who recruited him to a position as a Special Tasks Group officer. Zirfiel has been quietly handling problems for the Temple ever since.

> ## Special Tasks Group

> The Milzusvian Special Tasks Group (STG) grew out of the archaeology practice of the temple - after repeated extraplanar disasters in the early decades of the Archives division, the clerical council trained a small, loose and largely unacknowledged corps of operatives to investigate, secure and neutralize arcane phenomena and artifacts.

> A quiet arrangement has been struck between the temple and a few of the leading noble families of Waterdeep - in exchange for cover and access, the STG occasionally undertakes operations that need to be officially deniable.
